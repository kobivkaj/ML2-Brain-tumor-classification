#### Instructions
You can open the file MRI_Brain_Tumor.ipynb in google colab or use this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vkfnGmyXDY02GhqtHJPt5MOrHkm1y-3H?usp=sharing

If you are using this project on your device, follow these steps:
- Create pyenv:
  - Install Python 3.12.3 with `pyenv install 3.12.3`
  - Create a virtual environment with `pyenv virtualenv 3.12.3 myenv`
  - Activate the virtual environment with `pyenv activate myenv`
- open the file MRI_Brain_Tumor.ipynb and start with the exploration

#### Project structure
- The trained models you find in the MRI_Brain_Tumor.ipynb 
- The combine_data.py is the scrip to conbine the tree data sets together
- The dataaugmentation.ipynb file is the code with I used to generate more image data but the code is also in the MRI_Brain_Tumor.ipynb file
